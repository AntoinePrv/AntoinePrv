I'm a scientist turned research engineer with a deep passion for 
machine learning and mathematical optimization, which I cultivated 
during my Ph.D. in Montreal.

I specialize in transforming cutting-edge research ideas into robust,
high-performance, production-grade libraries and tools.
My expertise lies in crafting reliable solutions that seamlessly
integrate into diverse programming languages and environments.

I thrive in rigorous development environments, where strong testing
practices and static type-checking ensure code safety and maintainability.
I believe in the power of building foundational, dependable tools that
serve as universal building blocks for innovation.
